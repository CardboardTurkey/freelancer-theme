  <p>
    This very website you're viewing is self-hosted on a raspberry pi and was
    built by myself off a
    <a href="https://github.com/CardboardTurkey/freelancer-theme/tree/my-portfolio">jekyll theme</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I tried to follow "infrastructure as code" as much as possible when
    building the hosting, using a mixture of
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/CardboardTurkey/website">docker compose</a>
    and systemd services embedded in 
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/CardboardTurkey/nixos-config/-/blob/main/user-config/other/webserver.nix">nix</a>.
